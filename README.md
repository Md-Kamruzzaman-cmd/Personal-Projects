# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown
PowerBI project to visualize total survey takers, average age, average salary, salary by country etc. 

Data Transformation :

1. Removed empty columns.
2. separated column of Q1 by delimeter("(") and remove newly created column.
3. sperated column of Q5 by delimiter (":") and remove new column.
4. In Q3 column replaced k+ with 000 then k with 000 so we can calculate properly. split the column by
delimeter ("-"). add a new column named average salary (in USD) by adding these 2 columns and divided
by 2 to get average salary. remove previous 2 columns.
5. followed step 2 for column Q11.
